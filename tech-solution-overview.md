### Business Model & Financials

The company is currently bootstrapped, with an initial operational budget of 50,000 to 1,00,000 INR (approx. $600-$1,200 USD) covered by the existing co-founder. The immediate financial goal is to secure pre-seed funding to facilitate growth and begin paying salaries. The business model is initially project-based, providing custom AI solutions to B2B clients across various industries. The long-term vision includes transitioning to a Software as a Service (SaaS) model and exploring Intellectual Property (IP) licensing.

### Team & Culture

The company is led by one initial co-founder with a background in software architecture and product leadership. The culture is defined by visionary thinking, an exceptional work ethic, risk-taking, resilience, a builder mentality, and a passion for futuristic AI. Due to its early stage, the company cannot currently offer traditional employee benefits, but this is a priority for the future.
